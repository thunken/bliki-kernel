# ðŸ¦† bliki-kernel

`bliki-kernel` is a trimmed-down fork of Bliki, a parsing library for Wikitext in Java.

All credit goes to Axel Kramer, Jan Berkel, and other contributors. We just removed stuff.

## Changelog

`bliki-kernel` was forked from commit [`8882759`](https://bitbucket.org/axelclk/info.bliki.wiki/commits/8882759847ae4913017379553bd4754734d73ac2?at=master) of https://bitbucket.org/axelclk/info.bliki.wiki.

Differences with `bliki`:
* `bliki-addons` and `bliki-creator` were removed, so this repository is a fork of `bliki-core` only
* All references to a specific SLF4J binding were removed (cf. https://bitbucket.org/axelclk/info.bliki.wiki/issues/47)
* All references to Scribunto and Lua were removed
* The POM file was trimmed down, and dependencies were updated to newer versions
* The JAR is obviously smaller, if you care about that
