;Only active template content is above.

;The verbatim active code within reads:
 abc'''&lt;onlyinclude>'''def'''&lt;/onlyinclude>'''ghi'''&lt;includeonly>'''jkl'''&lt;/includeonly>'''

If transposed, the only part included will be the string literal <code>def</code>.

==Example==
Including [[:Help:Template/onlyinclude demo]] yields only:
 {{:Help:Template/onlyinclude demo}}

<includeonly>Then there's this other stuff one would think would be included... (I)
</includeonly><noinclude>

[[Category:Handbook templates]]</noinclude>
[[Category:Template documentation|{{PAGENAME}}]]
</noinclude><includeonly>Then there's this other stuff one would think would be included (II)...</includeonly>
